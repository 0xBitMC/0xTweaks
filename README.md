This is how I make servers masterfully smooth with their TPS/MSPT

## 1.18.2 - Purpur:
These configurations are a basic optimization for 1.18.2 Servers running Purpur.

## 1.18.2 - EarthPol:
These configurations are based on optimizations for the EarthPol Earth Server running 1.18.2 Purpur on the following Recommended Hardware. These configurations are not for everyone. As of recent testing, these configurations can do 200 users on 20TPS/35-40MSPT.
### Recommended Hardware:
```
CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5900X
Allocated RAM: 12-20GB DDR4
Network: 2Gbps Up/Down
```
